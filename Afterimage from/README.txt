This piece uses the open-source Yamaha DX7 emulator "Dexed." Dexed 0.9.6 (current version as of 4-5-2021) is included in the subfolder "Dexed" in the patch folder, or the latest version can be downloaded at https://asb2m10.github.io/dexed/

Open the appropriate version for your operating system and install the VST on your computer. Note the location it is installed, so you can navigate there when you click "load VST plugin" in the patch.

Dexed setup:

E. PIANO 1 preset: open the VST interface; click "CART"; click "LOAD" and load ROM1A.syx. Go to the folder "Original Yamaha" under "CART" and choose DX7 ROM1->ROM1A.syx->E. PIANO 1.

Tuning: click "PARM"; click "SCL" under "Tuning": and load "19-godzilla9-131313313-over-12.scl" from the Max patch folder. The notated keys on the keyboard will now correspond to a 9-note subset of 19 equal divisions of the octave. 

Save: Click "STORE" on the main VST window and click "OK".

Note that the patch will auto-save the VST plugin location and settings for future uses.
